# Proof-of-work

# New Blocks

Miner sends a new block to other peers in the network

Peers validate if the puzzle was solves

Store new block and send it to its peers

Next blocks are built on top of newly mined block

# Ethereum Mining

Randomized process

What can increase chances

- More machines
- Better equipment

Mining done with powerful GPUs

- Usually by mining pools

Difficulty is automatically adjusted

- New block is generated every ~15 sec

# Mining Reward

Fixed amount of Ether per mined block

A portion of fees from all executed transactions

# 51% Attack

A miner can still reverse a transaction

- Need to generate a longer chain
- Need to have more than half of all mining resources
- Very expensive in practice

# Issues with Proof-of-Work

Requires a lot of energy - Power consumption of Kazakhstan - Carbon footprint of Sweeden
51% attack - Transaction can be reversed if one actor has majority of resources - Can be performed multiple times

# Proof-of-Work Energy Consumption

One Ethereum transaction with PoW 215.52 kWh
Same as 266 thousand VISA transactions
