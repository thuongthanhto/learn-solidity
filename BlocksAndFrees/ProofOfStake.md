# Proof-of-Stake

Alternative consensus algorithm

Set of validators

- Propose and vote on new blocks
- No need for miners

Stake Ether become a validator

- Cant't use it
- Stake is taken by the network if misbehave

Rewarded of block validation

- Part of transaction fees
- Smaller block reward

# Staking Pools

Individual validators requires 32 ETH

Staking pools combine ETH together to get a bigger stake

# Ethereum 2.0

Proof-of-stake: new consensus mechanism
Rollups: move execution off-chain
Sharding: split network into multiple chains
