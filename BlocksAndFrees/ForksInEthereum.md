# Forks in Ethereum

- Temporary disagreements between peers
- May have different and even contradictory states
- Caused by the decentralized nature of Etherum
- Should be resolved by the protocol

# Double Spend Attack

Spend a digital asset twice
Scenario:

- Pay for pizza with Ether
- Get your pizza
- Generate a longer chain without a single transaction
- Payment is reversed
- Can spend your Ether again!

# Preventing a Double-spend Attack

If anyone can add new blocks at any time

- Network is not secure

Need to have a leader

- Can't just select a permanent leader
- Would destroy decentralization!
- Need to give a change for any peer to become a leader

# Consensus Algorithms

Proof-of-Work: Solve a complex mathematical puzzel requires lots of resources
Proof-of-Stake: Allow to generate a block if a miner has put Ether at stake. Assets are "confiscated" if a miner tries to cheat
